## [v1.0.2] — Community Feedback Update

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed:** AOE Heal no longer crashes other players.
- **Fixed:** Signature Ability (Area Purge) no longer crashes other players.
- **Fixed:** Poison debuff now displays the correct status icon (was showing Burn icon).
- **Code cleanup:** removed unused empty properties.

### ⚖️ Balance

- Reduced stamina costs across all abilities:
  - Primary Attack: 2 → 1
  - Secondary (Self-Heal): 3 → 2
  - Charged (AOE Heal): 5 → 3
- Durability increased: 400 → 450

### ✨ New Features

- **Heal Screen Effect:** A green screen flash now plays when healing yourself (Secondary and AOE Heal), matching vanilla healing feedback.
- **Signature Speed Boost:** After using the Signature Ability, gain +movement speed for 3 seconds for tactical repositioning.
- **Drop on Death:** The Cleric Rod now drops on the ground when you die, like other vanilla weapons.
